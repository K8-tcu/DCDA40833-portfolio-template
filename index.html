            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Kate Strauch. I am a Strategic Communication major with minors in Digital Culture and Data Analytics and Studio Art. One fun fact about me is that I was born in London, England.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I am very passionate about marketing and how to create effective campaigns. With my DCDA minor, I have gained a better understanding of interpreting data and digital patterns. With my Studio Art minor, I have gained a creative eye that helps me innovate and visualize campaigns.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I am hoping to gain confidence in website building through my last DCDA course. I have never done HTML code so I am eager to grow my skillset.</p>
